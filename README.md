A context API e-commerce application using React.js is a web application that allows users to browse, add, and remove items from a shopping cart, and complete an order. The application uses React.js, a popular front-end JavaScript library, to build a user interface and manage the application state.

The Context API is a feature in React.js that provides a way to pass data through the component tree without having to pass props manually at every level. In the context API, you define a context object that contains the data you want to pass down to child components. You can then use a provider component to wrap your component tree, and any component within the provider can access the context data using a consumer component.

In the e-commerce application, the context API can be used to manage the shopping cart state, including the items in the cart, the total price, and the number of items in the cart. The application can use the context API to provide a centralized place to manage the shopping cart state, and make it accessible to all components that need it.
